                    <b>Depth-first search and Breadth-first search graph implementation (2020)</b><br><br>
                    The implementation of a DFS and a BFS search algorithm in a graph. The solution involves the use of queue or stack, vectors, and
                    the chosen search algorithm.
                    In this project I was the main developer as an individual task for a computer science class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Cycle and bipartite graph detector (2020)</b> <br><br>
                    A program that determines if an inputted graph has any cycles in it and if it can be expressed as a bipartite. In this code it was used
                    a DFS algorithm and vectors.
                    I worked alone in this project for a data structure and algorithms course.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>BST App (2020)</b><br><br>
                    An application that creates a BST based on the inputs specified by the user. The program can also add a new node, erase a node,
                    search for a node, determine the number of nodes (size) and the number of levels (height) of a binary search tree. In addition, it is
                    also possible for the program to determine the level of a single node, print the ancestors of a specified node and pint the graph in
                    preorder, inorder, postorder and level by level.
                    This project was developed by me for a data structure and algorithms course in my 3rd year of college.

                    <ol>
                      As part of a college intern program, I took part in reporting procedures and internal auditing in the company SAP
                        	During this experience I collaborated alongside SAPâ€™s human resources and IT team to implement an 
                        app made with BTP in which we developed an organizational chart and various procedure reports.
